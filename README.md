Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)

Overview

The Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) leverages quantum mechanics to produce truly random numbers. Unlike classical random number generators that rely on deterministic algorithms (making them pseudo-random), quantum superposition ensures genuine randomness. This project implements a QRNG using quantum circuits, making it suitable for cryptographic applications.

Problem Statement

Creating a 'Quantum Random Number Generator' for cryptograpic applications

Implementation Details

Quantum Representation
A qubit is initialized in a superposition state using the Hadamard gate.
When measured, the qubit collapses into either |0⟩ or |1⟩ with equal probability, ensuring true randomness.

Quantum Circuit Design
Initialization: Apply a Hadamard gate to create a 50/50 superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩.
Measurement: Collapse the quantum state by measuring it in the computational basis.
Bitstream Generation: Execute the quantum circuit multiple times to generate a sequence of random bits.
Post-Processing: Classical techniques (such as randomness extraction) can be applied to remove bias if necessary.

Tools & Libraries Used

Qiskit: For quantum circuit simulation and execution.
Python: To implement logic and control program flow.
Matplotlib & NumPy: For data visualization and statistical analysis of generated random numbers.
